# FishNet-Addressables-Sample
An addressables 2D URP sample for FishNet in Unity created by Shadowfinder Studios. WIP

Features:
* Scene loaded at runtime when an object is collided by a player.
* Addressable trees loaded with that global scene.
* Rideable rowboat.

Instructions to play:

1. Walk to the right to trip the loadable area.

2. When the next scene loads, you can press Spacebar to spawn trees.

3. Trees cannot be spawned in the main scene until you walk into the next scene because that's when the addressables load.

4. Press 1 or 2 or click the tree icons at the bottom of the screen to switch between tree types.

5. Press E near the boat to ride it and E again to dismount.
