# FishNet-Addressables-Showcase
A W.I.P. 2D URP showcase for FishNet in Unity created by Shadowfinder Studios.

This sample showcases different topics, among them:
* Addressables
* Scene loading; global, with addressable loading
* Rideable vehicles; rowboat.

The sample is set up to work with Unity Multiplayer Play Mode for quick testing.

Instructions to play:

Showcase 1 - Scene loading and addressables

1. Walk to the right to trip the loadable area.

2. When the next scene loads, you can press Spacebar to spawn trees.

3. Trees cannot be spawned in the main scene until you walk into the next scene because that's when the addressables load.

4. Press 1 or 2 or click the tree icons at the bottom of the screen to switch between tree types.

Showcase 2 - Rideables

1. Press E near the boat to ride it and E again to dismount.

2. Move around after using the boat to ride it around.

3. The boat cannot pass thru the ground, but can pass through the water due to tilemap colliders.

Showcase 3 - Mineable Rocks

1. Walk up to a rock.

2. Press E near the rock to swing the pickaxe at it.

3. Keep hitting the rock until it turns to rubble.

4. ???
