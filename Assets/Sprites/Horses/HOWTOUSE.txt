Version: 0.9.0
Changes: Now works for all of bluecarrot16's horses. I made many tweaks to the original algorithm, and many little draws to help ensure as much layer compatibility as possible

Special Note: In order to work for female, you must have a matching male/female piece of equipment from the waist down, as all legs drawn are male. I achieved best results by still using male for the bottom legs (Also is super easier) Slightly buffer legs will be easier to notice on the horse anyway. The female legs simply do not extend out enough to be seen.

Using this horse cutout to provide good results for almost all animation cycles will require drawing only part of some frames of certain sprites along with different parts of others.

The cutouts are in 5 folders and labeled with the following:
sf - foreground horse for standcycle
sb - background horse for standcycle
ef - foreground horse for eatcycle
eb - background horse for eatcycle
wf - foreground horse for walkcycle
wb - background horse for walkcycle
rf - foreground horse for gallopcycle
rb - background horse for gallopcycle

Here is all of the delicate alignment to make it look good:

Player X we will call px
Player Y we will call py

At the bottom is a table that provides modx and mody values for each cycle, ridestep and direction


Look up your modx and mody values for your situation.

If the action is male/female castcycle or the male idle, add 1 to modY
If the action is female slashing, decrease modY by 1

For up-facing direction:
Draw the background-horse at px - 32, py - 32
Regardless of gender, draw the doll as a MALE at px + modX - 2, py + modY + 46 at the 6th frame of the castcycle, but only draw the leftmost 34 pixels within the bottommost 18 pixels
Draw another male with all the equipment, also 6th frame of castcycle , but this time draw it at px + modX + 32, py + modY + 46. Draw the leftmost 31 pixels within the bottommost 18 pixels
If the current cycle is shoot, add 1 to modx for just the next draw
Now draw your correctly-gendered sprite (with all equipment including weapons/shield) at px + modx, py + modY in whatever frame of whatever cycle you wish, but only draw top 52 pixels




For left-facing direction:
draw your correctly gendered sprite at px + modX, py + modY + 50, in any frame/cycle, only the top 50 pixels
Draw a MALE version of your sprite (but without any weapons or shields) at px + modX, py + modY, in the 3rd frame of the thrustcycle, only the 14 bottommost pixels

For the down-facing direction:

Draw the background-horse at px-32,py-32
Draw a MALE version of your sprite (with all equipment except shield/weapoons), in the 6th frame of the cast cycle, drawing only the bottommost 17 pixels
If the current cycle is shoot, add 1 to modx for just the next draw
Draw the correctly gendered sprite (including weps/shield) at px + modX + py + modY + 47, in whatever cycle/frame, only the top 50 pixels

For the right-facing direction:
Draw the correctly gendered sprite (incl wep/shield) at px + modx, py + mody, in any frame/cycle, top 50 pixels only
Draw the MALE sprite (without weap/shield) at px +modx, py + mody + 50, in the 3rd frame of the thrustcycle, bottom 14 pixels only


We're not done yet!

If its down-facing, draw the correctly-gendered sprite without anything but shield (no body either) at px + mody, py + mody, in whatever cycle/frame, whole 64x64

Now draw horse-foreground at px - 32,py - 32

If left-facing: The next 3 draws are for the sprite with ONLY foot layer (MALE)
Draw at px + modx + 32, py + mody, 3rd frame of thrust, rightmost 32 pixels within top 58 pixels
Draw at px + modx + 21, py + modY + 58, 3rd frame of thrust, rightmost 33 pixels within bottommost 6 pixels
Draw at px + modx + 30, py + mody + 59, 3rd frame of thrust, rightmost 34 pixels within bottommost 5 pixels

If right facing: The next 3 draws are for the sprite with ONLY foot layer (MALE)
Draw at px + modx, py + mody, 3rd frame of thrustcycle, leftmost 32 pixels within topmost 57 pixels
Draw at px + modx, py + mody + 58, 3rd frame of thrustcycle, leftmost 33 pixels within bottom 6 pixels
Draw at px + modx, py + mody + 59, 3rd frame of thrustcycle, leftmost 34 pixels within bottommost 5 pixels

If the direction is up OR down-facing: Add 1 to modx if shootcycle for next draw
Draw correctly gendered sprite (just swords/spears) at px + modx, py + mody, full 64x64

If the action ISNT shootcycle:
Draw just the HAIR/HATS/HEADS/ETC (anything drawn near top of head) at px + modx, py + mody, any frame/cycle, top 24 pixels only

If left or right facing:
Draw just the Shield, correctly gendered, at px + modx, py + mody, full sprite


If you've made it this far you are very good at following directions and are probably a programmer. Don't hesitate to ask if you need help implementing this, and it is coming to the sprite generator soon!
