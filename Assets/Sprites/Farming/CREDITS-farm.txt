Build a farm, in the style of the LPC! Kindly commissioned by Rupil. 

There are several excellent LPC asset packs to do with farming, but this pack should help you build a more complete farm. Contents: 
- Modular barn, in two colors: red and brown
- Towers/silos
- Granary
- Modular chicken coop and nesting boxes
- Apiary/beehives
- Sheds/stables
- Two new fences
- Farm crafting machines---butter churner, cheese press, mayonnaise maker
- Animated windmill blades and water wheels

Because the LPC assets span a range of time periods and technology levels, these assets are meant to be flexible; most buildings come in two styles: a more primitive style with thatched roofs and wattlework https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattle_(construction)---appropriate for medieval or pre-modern settings, and a more modern style (but still targeting an early industrial period---think the Victorian era). 

Animated windmill and water wheels were adapted from Ivan Voirol's excellent Slates set https://opengameart.org/content/slates-32x32px-orthogonal-tileset-by-ivan-voirol . I have drawn thatched roofs in the past, but I liked TheraHedwig's better https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-compatible-ancient-greek-architecture and so based this set of their roofs.
